## 🍕 PizzaMania – Customer Mobile Application

PizzaMania is a mobile-based food ordering platform developed as part of an academic Software Engineering coursework project.  
This repository contains the **customer-facing Android mobile application**, developed using **Android Studio and Java**, allowing users to browse menus, place orders, and track order status through a clean and intuitive interface.

The application integrates **Google Maps APIs** for location-based features and **PayHere Payment Gateway** to support secure **card-based online payments**, enhancing real-world usability and overall user experience.

## 📌 Project Overview

PizzaMania addresses common challenges in traditional food ordering systems, including:

- Manual order handling  
- Delayed order updates  
- Limited order visibility  

The overall platform consists of **two separate Android mobile applications**, each designed for a specific user role:

- 📱 **Customer Mobile Application** (this repository)  
- 🛠️ **Admin Mobile Application** (separate repository)  

This separation ensures **clear role management**, better maintainability, and a **scalable system architecture**, aligning with real-world mobile application development practices.
