## 🍕 PizzaMania - Customer Mobile Application

PizzaMania is a mobile-based food ordering platform developed as part of an academic Software Engineering coursework project.
This repository contains the customer-facing Android mobile application, developed using Android Studio and Java, allowing users to browse menus, place orders, and track order status through a clean and intuitive interface.

The application integrates Google Maps APIs to support location-based features, enhancing accuracy and overall user experience.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

PizzaMania addresses common challenges in traditional food ordering systems, including:

Manual order handling

Delayed order updates

Limited order visibility

The overall platform consists of two separate Android mobile applications, each designed for a specific user role:

📱 Customer Mobile Application (this repository)

🛠️ Admin Mobile Application (separate repository)

This separation ensures clear role management, better maintainability, and scalable system architecture, aligning with real-world mobile application development practices.

## 🎓 Academic Context

Programme: Higher National Diploma in Software Engineering

Institution: National Institute of Business Management (NIBM)

Assessment Type: Academic / Coursework Project

Project Domain: Android Mobile Application Development

This project was completed as a team effort under the academic guidance of Ms. Sumudu Chathurika, Lecturer at NIBM.

## 📱 Customer Mobile App Features

The customer-facing Android application provides the following core features:

🍕 Menu browsing

🛒 Food ordering

⏱️ Order status tracking

📍 Location selection with Google Maps integration

👤 User account management
